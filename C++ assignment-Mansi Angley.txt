Problems and Solution--

1).Create a class named 'Student' with a string variable 'name' and an integer variable 'roll_no'. Assign
the value of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll_no;
};

int main() {
    student st1;

    st1.name = "john";
    st1.roll_no = 2;

    cout << "Name: " << st1.name << endl;
    cout << "roll: " << st1.roll_no << endl;
}


2) Assign and print the roll number, phone number and address of two students having names "Sam"
and "John" respectively by creating two objects of the class 'Student'.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student
{
   private:
   int rl;
   int long ph;
   char name[40];
   char ad[59];

   public:
      void get()
      {
          cout<<"\n Enter the  Name Roll number phone number and address of student ";
          cin>>name>>rl>>ph>>ad;
      }

      void show()
      {
          cout<<"\n Enter the name  "<<name;
          cout<<"\n Enter the roll number "<<rl;
          cout<<"\n Enter the phone  "<<ph;
          cout<<"\n Enter the Address "<<ad;
      }

};

main()
{
      Student a,b;
      a.get();
      a.show();

      b.get();
      b.show();
}


3) Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by
creating a class named 'Triangle' with a function to print the area and perimeter.

#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

class Traingle
{
	private:
		int a,b,c;
		float area,perimeter,s;
		
	public:
	Traingle()
	{
		a=3;
		b=4;
		c=5;
	}
	void get()
	{
		s=(a+b+c)/2;
		area=sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c));
	   	cout<<"\nArea of tringle: "<<area;
	}
	void show()
	{
		perimeter=a+b+c;
	   	cout<<"\nPerimeter of tringle: "<<perimeter;
		
	}	
};

main()
{
	Traingle t1;
	t1.get();
	t1.show();
	
}


4) Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by
creating a class named 'Triangle' with the constructor having the three sides as its parameters.

#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
class tringle{
	public:
	   int a,b,c;
	   float area,perameter,sp;
	   tringle(){
	      a=3;
	      b=4;
	      c=5;
       }
	   void ar(){
	   	sp=(a+b+c)/2;
	   	area=sqrt(sp*(sp-a)*(sp-b)*(sp-c));
	   	cout<<"\nArea of tringle= "<<area;
	   }

	int area(int y,int z)
	{
		a=y;

   rectangle r1,r2;
   int a1,a2;
   
   a1=r1.area(4,5);
   a2=r2.area(5,8);
   cout<<"\nArea of first rectangle=  "<<a1<<"\n\t";
   cout<<"\nArea of second rectangle=  "<<a2;
}



6) Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two
functions. First function named as 'setDim' takes the length and breadth of the rectangle as
parameters and the second function named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and
breadth of the rectangle are entered through keyboard.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Area{
	public:
		int a,b,area;
		void setDim(){
			cout<<"Enter length and breadth =  ";
			cin>>a>>b;
		}
		int getArea(){
			area=a*b;
			return area;
		}
};
main()
{
	Area a1;
	int x;
	a1.setDim();
	x=a1.getArea();
	cout<<"\nArea of tringle: "<<x;
}


7) Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of
its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a function named 'returnArea'
which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of the rectangle are entered through
keyboard.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Area
{
	private:
		int p,q,area;
	public:
		
		Area(int x,int y)
		{
			p=x;
			q=y;
		}
		int getArea(){
			area=p*q;
			return area;
		}
};
main()
{
	int a,b;
	cout<<"Enter length and breadth = ";
	cin>>a>>b;
	Area a1(a,b);
	int x;
	x=a1.getArea();
	cout<<"\nArea of tringle = "<<x;
}



8) Print the average of three numbers entered by the user by creating a class named 'Average' having a
function to calculate and print the average without creating any object of the Average class.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class ave
{

	private : float a,b,c,avg;
	
	public: 
	
			void get()
			
			{
				cout<<"Enter 3 Numbers = ";
				cin>>a>>b>>c;
				avg = (a+b+c)/3;
			
			}
			void show()
			{
				cout<<"\n A= "<<a<<"\n B= "<<b<<"\n C ="<<c;
			}
			
			int show_data()
			{
				return(avg);
			}
	};
class B: public ave
{
		
};
	
main()
{
int ans;
B b1;
b1.get();
b1.show();

ans=b1.show_data();
cout<<"\n Ans= "<<ans;

}




9) Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex'
with separate functions for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by the user.

	int real;
	int imag;
public:
    
     
     void setvalue()
    {
        cin>>real;
        cin>>imag;
    }
	
    void display()
    {
        cout<<real<<"+"<<imag<<"i"<<endl;
    }
	 
    void sum(Complex c1, Complex c2)
    {
        real=c1.real + c2.real;
        imag=c1.imag + c2.imag;
    }
};
    
    
main()
    {
        Complex c1,c2,c3;
        cout<<"\nEnter real and imaginary part of first comp number=  "<<endl;
        c1.setvalue();
        cout<<"\nEnter real and imaginary part of second comp number=  "<<endl;
        c2.setvalue();
        cout<<"\nSum of two complex numbers is=  ";
        c3.sum(c1,c2);
        c3.display();
    
    }


10) Write a program to print the volume of a box by creating a class named 'Volume' with an
initialization list to initialize its length, breadth and height. (just to make you familiar with
initialization lists)

	v.Area();
	v.print();
}
